## About

This is a set of GitHub template repositories for **[p5.js](https://p5js.org/)**.  
Helps you write code and create sketches comfortably.

For the code editor, [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (or VS Code in short) is assumed to be used.

The templates are assisted by several JavaScript development tools:

||Tool|What's that|
|---|---|---|
|P|[Prettier](https://prettier.io/)|Code formatter|
|E|[ESLint](https://eslint.org/)|Code linter|
|T|[TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)|Typed JavaScript|
|R|[Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/)|Module bundler|

However you don't necessarily have to use all of them (see the template list below).

*Note:* These are not for complete beginners and assume that you know about the basics of JavaScript and p5.js. However you don't have to be an expert at all!


## List of templates

On your needs and preferences.

### [[ P ]](https://github.com/fal-works/p5js-template-p)

Everything is automatically beautiful. [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) formats your code.

### [[ PE ]](https://github.com/fal-works/p5js-template-pe)

Less bugs and more readability. [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) checks your code automatically.

### [[ PET ]](https://github.com/fal-works/p5js-template-pet)

Prevent wrong values. More code completion. Code documents itself. With [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

### [[ PER ]](https://github.com/fal-works/p5js-template-per)

Structure your source code with multiple files. [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) will bundle them.

### [[ PETR ]](https://github.com/fal-works/p5js-template-petr)

Combination of the two above.

### [[ PETR+ ]](https://github.com/fal-works/p5js-template-petr-plus)

No more global pollution. [p5.js instance mode](https://github.com/processing/p5.js/wiki/Global-and-instance-mode).  
In addition: [terser](https://terser.org/) minifies your code for distribution.

## Basic terms

### Git and GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.co.jp/) is an online platform for hosting code that is managed by Git.  

And [Git](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system, which will track changes to your code and do some other several jobs as well.

Using Git is not required; Git is quite useful but might also be a little difficult for programming beginners.

### npm

[npm](https://docs.npmjs.com/) is a large database on the web, from which you can download several packages including the tools described above.

It also provides a package manager tool (i.e. `npm` command).  
By installing [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) you'll be able to use it.


## How to download a template

Open a GitHub repository of any template linked above.  
Then do as follows:

### Without Git

- Just click the "Code" button and then "Download ZIP".

### With Git

1. Click the "Use this template" button.  
This will copy the template and create a new repository for you.
2. Click the "Code" button and check the URL for cloning the repository.
3. Clone the repository with `git clone` command or something else.
