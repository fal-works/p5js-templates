# What's this file?

[> Home](./)

## .vscode directory

This directory contains configuration specific to [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

- Each time you save the code you are editing, Prettier formats it and ESLint (if used) fixes some errors. This automatic behavior is enabled by `.vscode/settings.json`. You might also have your own settings that globally apply to all of your projects, but the local ones (in `.vscode` of each project) will override the global ones.
By the way VS Code has also its own default formatter. In many cases Prettier might be more useful but sometimes you might rather prefer the default one.

- `.vscode/tasks.json` defines the default build task invoked by `Ctrl + Shift + B` or `⇧⌘B`. See also the [Tips](./tips.md).

### LICENSE

Each template contains a `LICENSE` file, and its content is [Creative Commons Zero v1.0 Universal](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/) (CC0-1.0 in short). This means that you can copy and use the template without any restrictions.

Other related files:

- The `package.json` file also has a `license` field and its value should be consistent with the `LICENSE` file. See also the [documentation of package.json](https://docs.npmjs.com/cli/v6/configuring-npm/package-json).
- Templates using [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) also attach a `@license` tag when generating the output code (this is configured in the `rollup.config.js` file).

If you create a sketch using one of these templates and want to publish it including the code:

- You may want to remove the license (or attach another one instead) to protect your own code.
- There are several open source licenses and CC0 is one of the least restrictive. It may also take a little time to learn about copyright; let's check them out.

## .gitignore

This file is for specifying which files are to be ignored by [Git](https://git-scm.com/).

In case you don't use Git, you won't need that file as well.

### package.json

This file is necessary for using `npm` or other package managers. It contains several metadata including package dependencies.

It may also contain some user-defined scripts (called "npm scripts"), which are defined in the `scripts` field and can be run with command-line `npm run (command name)`.  
Some templates use [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and/or [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/) for building a JavaScript file to be run on browsers, and this process is automated and programmed with npm scripts.

### pnpm-lock.yaml

This file is generated by [pnpm](https://pnpm.js.org/) (see also the [Tips](./tips.md)), so if you don't use pnpm, you can remove that file.  
When installing dependencies, the default `npm` will generate `package-lock.json` instead.

These lock files may not be important for you but google around it if you're curious.

### style.css

This CSS file determines the visual appearance of `index.html`.

In each template, `style.css` removes margin/padding and sets `display: block` for the canvas. This is useful if you create sketches that fit to the entire window.

### .eslintrc.json

Configuration for [ESLint](https://eslint.org/).

ESLint is highly configurable; [here](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/) you can see a long list of rules.

Each template is designed to use [Prettier](https://prettier.io/) for formatting code and do not enable ESLint rules that only affect the appearance of the code.  
However, the `lines-around-comment` rule is enabled, because the behavior of this rule is not covered by Prettier. Unfortunately a [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) version of this rule [does not exist](https://github.com/typescript-eslint/typescript-eslint/issues/1933) at the time writing this.

### tsconfig.json

Configuration for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/).

This file will automatically referred by TypeScript compiler.

### rollup.config.js

Configuration for [Rollup](https://rollupjs.org/).

If you run the `rollup` command with `--config` option and do not provide any path, Rollup will refer to `rollup.config.js`.
